Deletes old rsync snapshots based on filename-encoded dates and
user-specified policy.

REQUIRES:
ghc

BUILDING:
make

There is no installer at the moment - add $(pwd) to your path.

USING:

Snapshot directories should all be in the same parent directory, with
a name like this:
  root-2010-03-28-1205+0000
where root is a user-chosen base name, and rest encodes the date.
See mksnap for an example.

Create a policy file like example.snap (there are more details below).
Then, sitting in your snapshot root directory, type:

 $ /path/to/example.snap --base root

This will generate a bunch of debugging info on stderr, and shell commands
on stdout - for each directory, there will either be an rm command to
remove it, or a shell comment giving the reason for keeping it.
You can pipe this into `sh' or `sudo sh' as appropriate.
