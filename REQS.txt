This file contains some bugs and feature requests.

feature request:  'keepLastN' - keep the last 3 backups, no matter how old
they are. Usecase: on my laptop, I run backups by hand because of
connectivity of ext HD. and I run snaprotate by hand. But if I don't backup
for a while and then run snaprotate, the most recent backup might pass out of
the 'keep last 48h' level and but not be kept by the 'once per month' or
'once per week' level. This will keep the N most recent backups, no matter
how old they are.

feature request: actually execute rm commands rather than outputting them

todo: idea from dmwit on reddit about using <() instead of explicit temp file
  (runhaskell from ghc 6.10.1 doesn't like FDs coming from <() and wants a
   real file, so maybe this won't work)

feature request: unify the time handling for withinDuration and perTimeFormat
so that "month" and "2 * month" can be used in either context.
